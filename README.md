# AI Interviewer

## Basic Description
AI Interviewer  is an AI-powered interview platform designed to simulate the interview process and assess various candidate skills. The project aims to build a functional prototype capable of conducting AI-powered interviews, analyzing candidate responses, and generating detailed performance reports. The platform will focus on the following key areas:

-   Assessing Skills and Competencies: Evaluate the candidate's expertise in relevant fields.
-   Behavioral Analysis  : Analyze the candidate’s responses to assess personality traits and behavioral tendencies.
-   Communication Skills  : Evaluate the clarity, tone, and structure of candidate responses.
-   Consistency and Objectivity  : Ensure fair and unbiased assessment based on candidate inputs.
-   Emotional Intelligence  : Assess the candidate’s ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions.
-   Technical Screening  : Perform technical evaluations, such as coding challenges or problem-solving scenarios.

The core goal of this project is to create a system that can intelligently interact with users, generate interview questions, evaluate answers, convert speech to text, provide feedback, and synthesize speech for a more human-like interaction.

## How to Use
To get started with   AI Interviewer  , follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
1.   Python 3.x   installed on your machine.
2. Install required libraries.
3. You’ll need   API keys   from:
   -   Gemini API   for AI-powered interview assistance.
   -   ElevenLabs API   for speech synthesis .


**How I Built the Project**  
The AI Interviewer project was developed using Python, HTML, and CSS. Although the project is still a work in progress, the following technologies and methods were used:
Backend: Python is used for handling the AI and NLP-related tasks, like question generation, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and answer evaluation.
Frontend: HTML and CSS are being used for the user interface, although integration with the backend is still under development.

API Integrations:
Gemini API: For AI-driven interview assistance and analyzing candidate responses.
ElevenLabs API: For speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities.
Currently, the backend and frontend are not yet integrated, and the system is in its basic form. The functionalities available so far include:
Question generation.
Answer evaluation.
Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion.
Feedback generation based on the candidate's responses.

**Tech Stack Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
gemini – For NLP and AI-powered features.
requests – For API integrations.

[Other libraries like SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, etc.]

Frontend:
HTML, CSS (for designing the user interface).

APIs:
Gemini API: For interview question generation and evaluation.
ElevenLabs API: For speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
Database: [Currently not implemented, but can be added in the future for storing interview data.]
The project is still under development, and improvements such as more advanced functionalities, complete frontend-backend integration, and enhanced AI features are planned for future updates.

**About PoTM Program**
This project is being developed as part of the PoTM (Program of The Month), organized by the IEEE Club of the CSE Department at BMSIT&M. The program aims to encourage students to work on innovative projects, gain hands-on experience, and develop practical technical skills.
Through this program, I have learned:
How to work in a team.
How to work with Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech technologies.
How to integrate third-party APIs for AI and speech functionalities.
Practical coding skills related to NLP, API integration, and developing interactive systems.
The importance of building interactive systems with real-time analysis and feedback.

**Future Work**
As of now, the project is in its initial stages and has the following features:
Question generation: AI generates interview questions for candidates.
Answer evaluation: The system evaluates responses based on predefined criteria.
Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech: The system can transcribe spoken words into text and convert text to speech.
However, the project needs significant improvements, including:
Full integration of the frontend and backend.
Enhanced question generation and more advanced technical screening.
Deeper emotional intelligence analysis.
Improved feedback mechanisms.
More comprehensive report generation for candidates.
